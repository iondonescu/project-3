## Instructions
Right before starting the game you see sixteen cards turn backface. There are eight pairs of cards, representing eight breeds of cat.
The goal of the game is to guess all matching pairs of cat breeds.
Clicking on a card it will show its face. Same with the second card, and if the cats breed matches
you will be gratified with a "meow" sound and the cards stay open. If not, the two cards turn back and  you will hear a sound of mismatch.
If the sounds annoy you, you can turn it off clicking on the sound button.
Playing, you can see the game time starting from the first card you reveal and a three stars rating.
There is also a counter of how many playing cards you have seen.
If the counter reaches thirty, one star's rating will be remove.
If the counter reaches fifty-five, another star's rating will be remove.
Every moment of the game you can reload it, but be aware that the playing cards aren't in the same position.
Matching all the cards, you have finished the game and a pop-up window will display your playing time and star rate.
Of course, you are free to play the game again!
Enjoy!!!!!!.

PS: I hope you finish the game within an hour, otherwise you aren't a cats lover , and you should get a dog. :)
